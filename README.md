# Smartgas - Fuel Price Observatory
This application was developped as part of the 9th semester course, Software Engineering of the National Technical University of Athens, taught by Konstantinos Saidis and Vasilios Veskoukis in the winter semester of 2018. The project was developped by a team of 6 members.

## Task description

### General description
The project task is to develop an online price observatory, wich will allow users to record electronically fuel prices in various gas stations. The observatory will operate by crowdsourcing, so volunteers record prices to share them with others through a web service. Special emphasis should be placed on the development of the appropriate web API.

### Technical Specifications
* The observatory shall consist of (a) a backend and (b) a frontend subsystems, which should be implemented in Java, Javascript or similar. 
* The language of the user interfaces should be in Greek.
* A build automation tool of team's choice should be used.
* The observatory should provide an appropriate RESTful Web API to interface with third party applications. 
* The following three user roles should be supported: 
  - registered user - volunteer
  - administrator
  - reader 
* HTTPS protocol should be supported for all pages and utilities via self-signed certificate.
* Spatial display of data should be done through a platform with an online map service (e.g. Google Maps or equivalent) with use of a suitable javascript library (openlayers, mapbox or other).
* Responsive, user-friendly designed and fully funcional pages should be provided in a uniform way for Desktop, Tablet and Mobile devices.
